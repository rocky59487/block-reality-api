/**
 * Cable Management SPI — Manages rope/cable tension physics in the game world.
 *
 * 纜索管理 SPI — 管理遊戲世界中的繩索/纜索張力物理。
 *
 * The cable manager maintains a collection of cable elements between blocks,
 * handles cable creation/removal, and advances cable physics each tick.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Create and remove cable connections between blocks
 * - Query active cables and their properties
 * - Advance cable physics (update tension based on block positions)
 * - Detect broken cables and fire events
 * - Thread-safe access from game and physics threads
 *
 * Modules implementing this SPI should:
 * - Support concurrent read/write operations
 * - Fire CableTensionEvent when tension changes significantly
 * - Return broken cables from tickCables() for removal by caller
